Design:

1. I think thinking about/utilizing the waterfall method was the most helpful for me for this project because that allowed me to prioritize the main functions for the bot that we built.

2. The most difficult part of this project was learning to code with the discord and firebase apis since I have never used them before

3. I definetly want to continue to use the waterfall method because it makes the most sense to me to code in that very sequential way.

Implementation:

1. The most helpful thing while testing the bot was constantly testing the code. This was super helpful because it would make it super obvious what worked and what didn't, and pairing that with print statements that printed to terminal made it very easy to troubleshoot.

2. The most difficult part of implementation was trying to make sure all the keys for the bot and for the firebase were right. I used the online documentation from both the discord and firebase websites so I'm not sure what I could do to make it easier. I think the more familiar I get with this type of programming the more comfortable I'll be

3. I love using unit testing and system testing simultaneously with system testing first. I personally think this is the best way to test a system because if the program runs no issues with system testing, then you don't even need to do unit testing. Unit testing is good to figure out where specific bugs are which is why I love using it.

Process:

1. Kanban made it very easy to keep track of what else we needed to add into our code and code reviews made it easy to make sure that every one knew what the code did.

2. The most difficult part of the process was making sure we stayed on track with our code plans. Also, it was hard learning firebase and discord since I never used it before.

3. I definetly want to keep using kaban boards because they are super helpful for keeping track of what you have completed and what else you need to add to a project. It also helped us stay on track with our timeline.
